<h1>Dastardly Deeds</h1>
<small>Version 1.30 / UPDATED 02.09.21</small>

<h5>IMPORTANT</h5>
<li>Salty Chat has been updated to version 2.2.0 (Please update your client, if you haven’t already).</li>

<h2>Crafting System</h2>
<li>Many recipes have been added to the world for you to discover! Since we’re not chaotic evil, we’ll give you one: <i>using 10 sticks or 1 log in your satchel or workbench will create a campfire</i>.</li>
<li>Most recipes involve some sort of crafting, cooking, and/or distilling. We expect that information about this crafting system to be traded through in-character interactions. Furthermore, we’ve tried our best to make the required items pretty self-evident, so play around by dragging different items, item combinations, and quantities, into different crafting contexts to find out!</li>
<li>Campfires and cooking pots already in the world can now be used to open the campfire / cooking crafting context. Just make sure the fire is lit!</li>
<li>Distillers have been built inside various moonshining shacks found throughout the world and can be used to open the distilling crafting context.</li>
<li>Workbenches, such as the one found inside the Valentine stables, can be used to open the workbench crafting context. Allowing you to craft with larger recipes.</li>

<h2>Player Searching / Robbing</h2>
<li>The player search mechanics have been opened up for all players.</li>
<li>In order to initiate a search, a player must have their hands up, be hogtied, or cuffed.</li>
<li>To search on a player, right-click to focus on them and use the “Search” prompt.</li>
<li>Searching allows the searcher to freely move items between the searchee and their inventory / equipment bar.</li>

<h2>Lock Picking / Safe Cracking</h2>
<li>Some doors throughout the world can now be lock picked.</li>
<li>A variety of storage containers are now in the world and may be locked, get to crackin!</li>
<li>As a note, both minigames have very fine audio cues for knowing when things are just right, be sure to listen carefully.</li>
<li>During lock picking you must click and hold and drag to move the lock pick and set the pins appropriately.  If you move too fast, too far, etc the lock pick may break.</li>
<li>During safe cracking you must click and hold and drag in a circular motion to move the safe dial.  For players information, to open a safe lock, you must go 3 revolutions to the left first (on the 4th revolution you will hear your first click when it hits the right number), then 2 revolutions right past the previous number (on 3rd revolution click will occur on correct number), 1 revolution left past the previous number (on 2nd revolution click will occur on correct number), then swing right again until the safe opens.  Good luck!</li>
<li style="color:red">NOTE: IF YOU TURNED OFF YOUR REDM/CHROMIUM SOUNDS IN VOLUME CONTROL, TURN THEM BACK ON OR YOU WILL FAIL AT BOTH OF THESE!</li>
<li>Artwork for both of these mini-games was done by Osario, our newest member of the creative direction team. Original concept art was drawn by iNj3cTeD and Weiner.</li>

<h2>Bank Robberies</h2>
<li>The bank robbery activity has been added to the world in two locations: Blackwater and Valentine.</li>
<li>Starting a bank robbery will notify the LEO of suspicious activity.</li>
<li>Bank robberies require careful planning, certain items, and skillful hands to accomplish them successfully. They aren’t as simple as just standing there!</li>
<li>During a bank robbery, the building will go into “lockdown” preventing players from using their banking feature for 60 minutes.</li>
<li>Bank robberies have a 4hr cooldown before more valuables can be looted from safes within the vault. (We don’t want to overwhelm LEOs!)</li>
<li>Banks are now fully staffed with bank tellers and guard NPC(s). The guard WILL be hostile towards anyone who breaks in.</li>
<li>Bank robbery difficulty and rewards will be adjusted over time as we gain more insight on how players use the system.</li>
<li>To initiate a bank robbery, the teller gates or back door can be lock picked, you will only be able to do this if 4 LEO are clocked in.  The automated system will tell you if this is possible when you attempt to do so.</li>
<li>Players have a 4 day cooldown for being involved in bank robberies, please refer to ruleset.</li>
<li>Please ensure you read the rule set that has been formed around Bank Robberies so there is no confusion as to what is acceptable.</li>

<h2>Moonshining</h2>
<li>Crafting mash is now done through satchel or workbench crafting contexts, and the recipe has changed to no longer include the bucket, an updated pamphlet can be found, if you already have one or by buying one.</li>
<li>Crafting moonshine requires a distiller, which can be found in the aforementioned places.</li>
<li>Lowered sell price of moonshine to $3.00.</li>
<li>Otis the moonshiner has been moved to a new location (the man who buys your shine!).</li>

<h2>Moonshine Runs</h2>
<li>Moonshine run activities have been added to the world, available at all locations you would normally expect to find them.</li>
<li>Moonshine runs will notify the LEO of suspicious activity.</li>
<li>Moonshine runs currently cost 50 moonshine and must be redeemed at the NPC runners (you will know it when you see it) and you must have 50 moonshine in your inventory to even make the start locations appear around you.</li>
<li>To offset the decreased risk of new moonshine creation techniques (through crafting) and the decrease in sell price of moonshine itself, we created moonshine runs to add more risk, more reward to the system in full.  Moonshine runs are optional and not required, a person can still sell moonshine as is.</li>
<li>Moonshine runs have a cooldown per location of 2 hours (preventing others from using it for the cooldown duration).</li>
<li>When the delivery job timer runs out, the vehicle will be… dismantled.</li>
<li>There must be a minimum of 2 LEO online to start a moonshine run.  The system will let you know if you can start one or not, so no guesswork when trying to do one.</li>

<h2>Anonymous Tip Line (ANON)</h2>
<li>An anonymous tip line has been added to the game for LEOs to view, and players to send telegrams to.</li>
<li>Players who wish to send a telegram to the anonymous tip line may send a telegram to ANON (non case sensitive) and the LEOs will receive it at their desks.</li>
<li>Tip lines reside at all front desks of each sheriff office. You will receive a prompt for the tip line when standing in front of it.</li>
<li>The automated suspicious activity system will automatically send a telegram to the anonymous tip line with available details of the suspicious activity that was spotted.</li>
<li>If suspicious activity is spotted by the automated system (through bank robberies or moonshine runs), LEOs will receive a notification in the top right that such a message was delivered.  Visit your nearest sheriff office to view details about it.</li>

<h2>Detail System (aka Scene)</h2>
<li>/detail will now allow you to place a message in the world resulting in an eye icon that lives in the world for a specified period of time that any player can view.  There is a max of 50 characters, much like the /me system.</li>
<li>Players can only have 10 per character active at any time.  Once you remove one manually or it’s timer runs out on active ones in the world, you will then be able to place another.
- Players can view the details in the world by looking for the eye icons that other users have placed by walking up to them and using the Left Alt prompt.</li>
<li>Players can remove their own active detail messages by using Backspace prompt while next to a detail.</li>
<li>Detail messages cannot be placed too close to one another (Prompt distance showing/hiding worth).</li>
<li>We expect players to utilize proper behavior when placing these messages in the world.  Anything deemed inappropriate will be removed and harsh punishment will ensue ::KONOSMASH::</li>
<li>This is not a substitute for a note / physical letter system, that will come in a future patch.</li>

<h2>/Sit and /Lay system</h2>
<li>You may now lay on beds throughout the world using the /lay command.</li>
<li>You may now sit on chairs, couches, and benches and start one of 12 female (11 male) scenarios. Usage /sit #.</li>
<li>The system will detect an object near/next to you that is sittable and attempt to sit you in it running the specified version with the # (i.e. /sit 7 will sit comfortably with your hands in your lap)</li>

<h2>Character Permissions / Professions</h2>
<li>Profession based permissions such as Law Enforcement, Train Conductor, Doctor, and Newspaper will now be assigned directly to the character and not the whole account.</li>
<li>Professions now have had their pay increased, and this will be tracked and adjusted over time.</li>

<h2>Placement System</h2>
<li>A new preview of our placement system has been added.</li>
<li>This system is accessible through placing a campfire, craft one and try to place it in the world.</li>
<li>This system will be fine tuned over time and will eventually lead into player campsites and other features.</li>

<h2>Improved / Added Animations</h2>
<li>Pointing now uses a more satisfying animation and properly twists your body and points in the direction your camera is facing.</li>
<li>Putting hands up now has a smooth transition, making it feel more realistic.</li>

<li>This feature is mainly for learning and will not yield anything great in terms of reward for cracking it.</li>

<h2>Server Stability</h2>
<li>The server now has a player ping limit of 300, this is configurable and we will adjust it if necessary.  Expect for the server to not allow your connection if your ping is too high!</li>
<li>The server will now prevent connection from players who are still connected according to the server.  This can be sometimes due to crashing or restarting the game.  We believe this to be some of the causes of recent instancing issues and are hopeful this will resolve the issue.  We have also ensured the grace period for crashes and disconnects for both in game and in the queue are properly set.</li>
<li>Improved stability of other issues that should lessen the likelihood of instancing occurring.</li>
